WHAT ARE CTFs?

They are information security competitions that challenge contestants to solve a variety of tasks ranging from a scavenger hunt on wikipedia to basic programming exercises, to hacking your way into a server to steal data. In these challenges, the contestant is usually asked to find a specific piece of text that may be hidden on the server or behind a webpage. This goal is called the flag, hence the name!


In order to compete in CTFs, a participant is expected to have a wide range of skills including but not limited to:

1. Cryptography        - practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries.

2. Hashing             - transformation of a string of characters into a usually shorter fixed-length value or key that represents the original string.

3. Pwning              - Exploitation & Breach of remote servers to gain access to data (usually the flag) 

4. Steganography       - Practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object. In computing/electronic contexts,
                         a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video.

5. Networking          - Network protocols, Packet Capture & Parsing, Port Scanning, vulnerability analysis & network exploitation.

6. Reverse Engineering - Deconstruction of software to attain design information

7. Binary Analysis     - Threat assessment and vulnerability testing at the binary code level. This analysis analyzes the raw binaries that compose a complete 
                         application, which is especially helpful when there isn't access to the source code.

8. Forensics           - Application of investigation and analysis techniques to gather and preserve evidence from a particular computing device in a way that is     
                         suitable for presentation in a court of law
